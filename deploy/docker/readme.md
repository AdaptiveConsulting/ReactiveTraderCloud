  - broker
  - eventstore
  - blotter
  - pricing
  - referenceDataRead
  - tradeExecution

### Install docker on windows/mac:

- go to [toolbox download page](https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox) and click on your OS (version 1.9.1c on writing moment)
- install
- select Virtual Box/docker, Kitematic and git are optional
- then launch `Docker Quickstart Terminal`
- run `docker ps` and control that it match the following
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS

### Docker Quickstart Terminal tips (For windows 7)

- go to `properties` (click on left top corner -> Properties)
- Check `QuickEdit Mode` and `Insert Mode`, 
- go to `layout` and enlarge width to your convenience 
- `copy`: select a zone with the mouse and right click
- `paste`: press `insert` or `right click` under a container
- `.bashrc` file is named `.bash_profile` and need to be placed in your user folder
- on windows, you can create file starting with dot like this: `.bash_profile.` will create `.bash_profile`

### Some known issues (Toolbox on Windows and MacOSX)

The different scripts here will need to share code with the different containers. On Windows and Mac, the sharing is between the container and the virtual machine. The virtual machine is defined to share your home folder (/c/Users/ for windows or /Users for mac). If your git clone folder is a children folder of your home user, it's fine. Else you need to open Virtual Box and share that specific folder.
