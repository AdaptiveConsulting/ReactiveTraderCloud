# This script work as a fix to get node cache.
# Sometime, when running npm install inside docker container
#   that share the node_modules with the host, sync error are reported,
#   making the build to fail.
# The idea is to :
#  - copy the client src inside the container,
#  - remove node_modules as the HOST is certainly not the same env
#      as it is inside the container
#  - copy a host `.npm` cache into the container to accelerate the build
#  - copy back the `/root/.npm` cache when the npm install is finished
#  - finally, we get a copy of the dist folder to an host shared folder `/dist`

# fail fast
