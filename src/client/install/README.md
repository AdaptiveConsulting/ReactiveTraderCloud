# OpenFin installers

> **WARNING: Don't move or rename the installers in this directory. Those are linked to other sites and moving/renaming would break the links.**

## TLDR;

To generate the installers, run `npm run openfin-build-installer` from the `src/client` directory.

Note that [the installers](https://openfin.co/documentation/options/#installer) are just a 
wrapper containing **the URL** to the manifest, (**not** the manifest file itself), so there's 
no need to re-generate an installer when making changes to the manifests - When the updated 
manifest files are merged to the corresponding branch, the installer will pick up the changes.

## Explanation

The installers in this directory are generated by using OpenFin's online service. This process consists on:
1. Sending an HTTP GET request to a given endpoint, providing the following parameters on the query string:
- `config`: A URL pointing to a manifest `.json` file for the OpenFin app
- `fileName`: without extension
2. The response to that request will be the `${fileName}.exe` installer file for Windows, 
containing the URL of the manifest, which will be retrieved every time the installer runs and 
used to bootstrap the application.

The script in `src/client/lib/downloadInstaller.js` automates this process, by constructing the
 URL of each manifest file and downloading each installer from the service.
