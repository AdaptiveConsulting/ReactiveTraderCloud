/**
 `SpotTileData` has optional `notional` field, but notice that `SpotTileDataWithNotional` has required notional field.
 This has been done because we don't know notional when we create `SpotTileData`, default `notional`
 will change from currency to currency.
 We are adding a default `notional` in the spotData selector based on currency (see `spotTile/selectors.ts`).
 I can't say that I like this approach - I would prefer to control this data dependency
 in a high-level reducer. But it would have been much bigger change - resetting reference
 data would need to create new tiles in reducer, then new tiles will need to reset all records in
 `tileData` slice. I'd like to address that some other time and left some TODOs
