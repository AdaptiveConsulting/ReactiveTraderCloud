7. Run _Glue42 Desktop_ again
8. From the _Applications_ menu, search by the _reactive_ keyword and bookmark the _Reactive Trader_ app for easier access by clicking on the star icon
9. Launch _Reactive Trader_ (if you have it already running on _http://localhost:3000/_)
   - By clicking the app in AppManager
   - By using the _Reactive Trader Workspace (Swimlane)_ from the _Restore Layout_ menu item
