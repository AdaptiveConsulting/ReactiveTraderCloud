# UI Structure documentation

UI Components can be located in `./src/client/src/`

The app has 5 main routes (can run as a stand-alone) as described in `../apps/MainRoute/Router.tsx` <br />

- `/` - main application
- `/analytics` - analytics section
- `/blotter` - blotter section
- `/tiles` - workspace section, where all the spot tiles live.
- `/spot/:symbol` - a single spot tile (i.e. `/spot/eurusd`, `/spot/usdjpy`)

<hr>

The main application can be broken down into 6 main sections: <br />
![RTC layout](./images/rtc-layout.png) <br />

- [**Header**](#header) section has the Adaptive logo and toggle theme button and in different platforms (OpenFin) also comes with window controls such as `minimize`, `maximize`, and `close`.
- [**Workspace**](#workspace) section houses all the spot tile currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, etc.). This section can be viewed in two ways, _'normal'_ and _'analytics'_.
- [**Spot**](./SpotTile-docs.md) - a single currency pair tile. This is where all trade execution happens.
- [**Analytics**](#analytics) section showcases the `Profit & Loss`, `Positions`, and `PnL` graphs in different forms.
- [**Blotter**](#blotter) section shows a table of all the executed trades.
- [**Footer**](#footer) section has a status button that toggles a service list pop-up showing the connection status of each services and the number of connected instances open.
