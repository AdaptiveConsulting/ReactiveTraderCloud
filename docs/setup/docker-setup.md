# Running on Docker

*N.B. the Windows portion of these instructions are for Docker Toolbox. We will upgrade to the Docker For Windows version ASAP*

The following instructions have been tested on: 
- Windows 7 / 10
- Ubuntu 14.04.3 / 15.10
- OS X 10.11.2 (15C50) / kernel 15.2.0

If you have any issues with this process, please have a look [here](docker-issues.md) where we have listed some of the known problems that may occur.

## Install docker for your OS

Follow the steps [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for instructions for your specific OS/distribution.

### Check your docker installation
#### Start toolbox for Windows/Mac user:
Launch `Docker Quickstart Terminal` - this will start a default virtual machine on which your containers will run. You'll see something like

```
                        ##         .
                  ## ## ##        ==
               ## ## ## ## ##    ===
           /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
           \______ o           __/
             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/

docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100
For help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com
``` 

Note the IP address as we'll use it to load the client later.


#### Linux users
Just check that docker is running with:

```bash
docker ps
```
This should output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID     IMAGE            COMMAND          CREATED          STATUS           PORTS            NAMES

```


## Clone the repository

Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud.git`

#### Note for Windows

If you are running on Windows, note that the OS line ending is `CRLF`. Since scripts we will run are written in bash and will run inside Linux containers, the required line ending is `LF`.
Therefore ensure that your checkout maintains `LF` line endings when cloning the repository.

Before cloning :
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Also for Windows, ensure that your cloned project is under your user folder. E.g.: `c:\Users\myname\repository\reactivetradercloud`. This is because on Docker on Windows uses a Linux Docker host running on VirtualBox, which needs folder sharing with Windows for which the User folder is shared by default.


## Running Reactive Trader Cloud locally via Docker

You can run Reactive Trader Cloud locally using pre-built Docker images by navigating to the `docker` folder and running the `./runAll` script

```bash
$ cd deploy/docker/
$ ./runAll
```

This will download the 4 images required for Reactive Trader Cloud and run them. Check that they are running:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```

Wait a short while for the services to start up, then in a browser navigate to the docker address (`localhost` for linux users and something like `192.168.99.100` for windows/mac users) and the web client will load.


## Build containers from source
 
Navigate to the docker folder
```bash
cd deploy/docker
```

You will find scripts to help build/run/test Reactive Trader components:
- prepare (to build and push)
- runAll
- testAll
- killAll

To build, run the following with a `BUILD_ID`, in this example we'll use `1`    

```bash
./prepare build services 1
```

This will run the following tasks:

- Build the .NET services container by
  - Download the base Docker image for .NET Core from https://hub.docker.com/r/weareadaptive/dotnet/
  - Build the server binaries in that container with the checked out server source code
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/servers` Docker image from the built services container tagged with the `BUILD_ID` provided and save locally

- Build the messaging broker container by
  - Download the crossbar Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/weareadaptive/crossbar/
  - Build the broker image by applying the checked out crossbar config file
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/broker` Docker image from the built broker container tagged with the `BUILD_ID` provided and save locally

- Build the client container by
  - Download the nodejs Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/weareadaptive/node/
  - Build the client app in that container with the checked out client source code and save the built client app files
  - Download the nginx Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/weareadaptive/nginx/
  - Copy the built client app files to the nginx container
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/web` Docker image from the nginx container with the client app files tagged with the `BUILD_ID` provided and save locally

- Build the eventstore container by
  - Download the Docker image for eventstore from https://hub.docker.com/r/weareadaptive/eventstore/
  - Run the built `reactivetrader/servers` container with a special flag and the eventstore container to populate data into the eventstore container
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/eventstore` Docker image from the eventstore container which now has the data populated, tagged with the `BUILD_ID` provided and save locally

The 4 `reactivetrader` images will contain all the components needed to run Reactive Trader Cloud. The `servers` image contain binaries for all server micro-services and can be run with a flag to indicate which service to run. 


Check the generated docker images by:
```bash
docker images
```
Will output something like:
```bash

```

Note that only these containers are used to run ReactiveTrader with the `1` build number:
```bash
reactivetrader/eventstore   0.0.1       0df22c060d23        8 seconds ago       562.1 MB
reactivetrader/web          0.0.1       d0412eae6ff5        15 seconds ago      146.5 MB
reactivetrader/broker       0.0.1       addab85a78aa        4 minutes ago       387 MB
reactivetrader/servers      0.0.1       cbc536864104        4 minutes ago       1.913 GB
```

You can then run the built images by passing the `BUILD_ID` to the `./runAll` script
```bash
$ ./runAll 1
```

Open a browser, navigate to the docker address (`localhost` for linux users and something like `192.168.99.100` for windows/mac users) and the web client will load.


## Test ReactiveTrader

After having started ReactiveTrader, you can run the tests.

If you build/run with a `build_id` (ie: `1`): 
```bash
./testAll 1
```

This should output something like this:
```bash
 
xUnit.net .NET CLI test runner (64-bit .NET Core ubuntu.14.04-x64)
  Discovering: Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.IntegrationTests
  Discovered:  Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.IntegrationTests
  Starting:    Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.IntegrationTests

...
some test data
...

  Finished:    Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.IntegrationTests
=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.IntegrationTests  Total: 8, Errors: 0, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Time: 9.464s
```

## Stop all the running containers

You can stop all the containers with:
```bash
$ ./killAll
```
