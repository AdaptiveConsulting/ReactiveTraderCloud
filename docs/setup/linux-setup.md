## Running Reactive Trader

Start Event Store by running

```bash
$ sudo service eventstore start
```

In a separate terminal, start Crossbar from the `/src/server` folder by running:

```bash
$ crossbar start
```

From the `/src/server` working directory, install the packages required by running:

```bash
$ dotnet restore
```

Populate eventstore with the following command:

```bash
$ dotnet run -p Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.Launcher --populate-eventstore
```

Then run the services:

```bash
$ dotnet run -p Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.Server.Launcher all
```

The services should now run and connect to Crossbar and Event Store.

To run each service individually, cd into each of the services (analytics, blotter, pricing, referenceDataRead, tradeExecution) and run `dotnet run`

Run the client app by following the instructions [here](../client.md)
