## Docker images
- `Build`: we use several docker images to build RTC:
    - **Base images**:
        - *Crossbar*: base for Broker
        - *Dotnet*: base for Servers
        - *Eventstore*: base for PopulatedEventstore
        - *Nginx*: base for web, nsgate and minikubegate
        - *Node*: base to build web content
    - **RTC**:
        - *servers*: An image to run all backends services containers:
            - Analytics
            - Blotter
            - Broker
            - Pricing
            - ReferenceDataRead
            - TradeExecution
        - *Web*: This service host the static content and act as a proxy in fron of the broker
        - *PopulatedEventstore*: A populated version of the eventstore image. We use servers to populate
        - *Broker*: A crossbar image with the configuration
    - **Utilities**:
        - *Gcloud*: image used for the clis Gcloud and Kubectl
        - *Minikubegate*: image that give access to RTC when running on local minikube cluster
        - *Nsgate*: image that give access to RTC when running on google cloud
        - *Testtools*: image with simple utilitise to connect and debug other services

## Procedure
### Setup and validate docker
follow the [docker setup instructions][docker-setup]

### Build containers from source
First define a [build id][builid] for your build. It's a string used to identify the images. For this documentation, we will use *localbuild*

You will find scripts to help build/run/test Reactive Trader components:
- prepare (to build and push)
- runAll
- testAll
- killAll

To build, run the following with the [build id][buildid], in this example we'll use *localbuild*

**Note:** Sometimes, when changing the node version in the build scripts, there could be cache coming from the mounted folders `//root/.npm` and `//client/node_modules` in your local machine that prevents the prepare script to run normally popping different node issues (See the references in the following script: `ReactiveTraderCloud/deploy/docker/web/build.sh`.).

If this is the case, go to the folders `rtc_nodemodules_cache_container/_data` and `rtc_nodemodules_cache_container/_data` and delete the cached contents inside those directories.

```bash
./deploy/docker/prepare build rtc localbuild
```

This will run the following tasks:

- Build the .NET services container by
  - Downloading the [base Docker image for .NET Core][dotnetcore-image]
  - Build the server binaries in that container with the checked out server source code
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/servers` Docker image from the built services container tagged with the [build id][build-id] provided and save locally

- Build the messaging broker container by
  - Download the [crossbar Docker base image][crossbar-image]
  - Build the broker image by applying the checked out crossbar config file
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/broker` Docker image from the built broker container tagged with the [build id][build-id] provided and save locally

- Build the client container by
  - Download the [nodejs base Docker image][nodejs-image]
  - Build the client app in that container with the checked out client source code and save the built client app files
  - Download the [nginx Docker base image][nginx-image]
  - Copy the built client app files to the nginx container
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/web` Docker image from the nginx container with the client app files tagged with the [build id][build-id] provided and save locally

- Build the eventstore container by
  - Download the [base Docker image for eventstore][eventstore-image]
  - Run the built `reactivetrader/servers` container with a special flag and the eventstore container to populate data into the eventstore container
  - Create a new `reactivetrader/eventstore` Docker image from the eventstore container which now has the data populated, tagged with the [build id][build-id] provided and save locally

The [4 `reactivetrader` images][docker-hub] will contain all the components needed to run Reactive Trader Cloud. The `servers` image contain binaries for all server micro-services and can be run with a flag to indicate which service to run. 


Check the generated docker images:
```bash
docker images
```
Will output something like:
```bash
