CircleCi read it's configuration in the circle.yml file defined at the ReactiveTraderCloud root directory.

Here is the file:

```yaml
general:
  branches:
    ignore: # (1)
      [...]

machine:
  services: # (2) build dependencies
    [...]

dependencies:
  cache_directories: # (3) cache between builds
    [...]

  override: # (4) build steps
    [...]

test:
  override: # (5) validation steps
    [...]

deployment:
  hub: # (6) deployment
    [...]
```

### Ignored branches

This allows us to ignore some branches.  
For now only documentation is skipped

### Build dependencies

We only have a dependency on docker at the moment

### Cache between builds

There is 2 states that circleci use to build RTC:

- base images downloaded from [hub.docker][dockerhub] if newer
- base images saved in a tar between builds (usefull only if build use same base images as previous build)

This section define the cache between the builds

### Build steps

This defines the procedure that we have to build RTC:

- load base images: "dotnet" "rabbitmq" "eventstore" "nginx"
- build new RTC docker images
- run the containers from images freshly built
- put the base images in a tar for cache

### Validation steps

Here we have simple basic tests:

- a curl to validate eventstore is running
- a test container plugged on RTC that do a smoke test

### Deployment

Finally, on git branches defined in this list, we push the RTC images to [hub.docker][dockerhub] to let us do a deployment.  
You can add your branch in this list to be able to do a deployment of your code. Note that only the merge are taken in account and a PR won't have its images pushed.

### Build number

CircleCi build RTC and use its build number to tag all docker images.  
This build number is the one that you need to use for deployments
