# Reactive Trader

Reactive Trader is a real-time FX trading platform designed to showcase reactive programming principles across the full application stack.

Originally [written in WPF and .Net](https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTrader), and now in React/Redux, .Net and Node.js, we continue to evolve the platform to use the latest technologies.

Please see [our Showcases page](https://weareadaptive.com/showcase/) for a full list of the latest features.
